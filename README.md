The purpose of this system is to manage an inventory whose size can change during gameplay by adding or deleting items. The system creates references to the Inventory Items scriptable objects and saves these references in a JSON file. When a new item is added or deleted, its reference is also updated in the JSON file. At the start of the game, the system loads the references from the JSON file and instantiates the inventory items accordingly. This ensures that the game always has the most updated set of inventory items, without the need to worry about the size of the inventory or cluttering your project with scriptable objects.
For simplicity, this example stores only the item's name and level, but you can add more information such as type, rarity, or specific game values (e.g., damage for weapons, health for potions). If additional information is added, make sure to include the necessary checks and comparisons when retrieving from or adding references to the JSON file.
